# ramps-box-i3

This is a parametric RAMPS enclosure with various tunable parameters. The included STLs are specifically for a RAMPS 1.4 with LCD board and a 40mm fan mounted on the interior top, with a mounting offset for a SeeMeCNC LaserCut Prusa i3 frame. The SCAD is easy to edit for other setups.

This enclosure provides 4 screw mounts on the rear of the box to secure your RAMPS board. Once mounted the plugs should align to the bottom openings. There's a slot on the rear side of the box to pass through all your printer control wires, keeping wires out of the way while allowing you to shift things around. By default a 40mm fan mounts on the inside-top, pulling air from below.

This box has separate mounting holes for the box itself. This is a tunable offset, originally intended to move the box out of the way of my X motor. The exterior risers ensure that the box clears the bottom threaded rod on my i3. The space behind the box is useful for the x endstop and motor wires to pass through.

When the box or lid are printed in translucent PLA it gives the status lights a cool glowing effect.
